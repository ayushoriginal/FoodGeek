###This Project is developed using Agile Software development methods in which solutions have evolved through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. 
We have tried to implement adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

# User Personas and How they influenced the UI/UX design

![tt](http://i.imgur.com/AqO0wpm.png)
### How it was used in the UI/UX design? 
1.  	Ram Prakash doesn’t want to involve traditional advertising to spread word about his restaurant. Our website design enables food outlets to showcase their menu items (On the Menu Page) with ratings information and comments (both positive and negative) from independent customers, thus making the reviews more authentic.
2.  	He finds it frustrating that only taste is used as a factor in judging the quality of the dishes. We have designed the ‘Add Food Item’ page in such a way that people need to provide ingredients information from which nutritional data would be generated in our final Menu Page. Thus, the nutritional information is also showcased along with the information about the dishes so that health conscious customers can make an informed choice and the food outlets are encouraged to serve nutritious food items. This satisfies Ram Prakash’s frustration that the quality and nutritional value of the menu wasn’t getting attention.
3.  	Ram Prakash is a family man. He doesn’t like to work overtime in the hotel. The website can be operated from anywhere and allows him to put out menus, read comments, receive feedback etc. from the comfort of his home. Thus, he can multi-task by being with his family and simultaneously supervising and managing the online presence of the hotel.

### How it was used in the UI/UX design? 
1.	Vartika Maheshwari doesn't want to waste in traveling from her college to the main market in search of good food. Our website enable her to find ideal recipes without wasting much of her time.
2.	Vartika is interested in knowing some regional recipes too. So our website enables her to see all the varieties of recipes, right from regional to international.
3.	Also, the site offers delivery options too, so she could put the food item whatever she likes in her cart and can buy food while sitting comfortably at hostel. Thus, she can get a very good service at door.

###  How it was used in the UI/UX design? 
1.	Manan wants to be a food blogger, that is he wants to write down his experiences with the different food  items and wish to provide his valuable review, We have included comments sections in which each user can provide his/her valuable feedback. This way it becomes easy for Manan to review the various food items.

2.	Our site provide nutritional value of the food by listing the various ingredients which makes the searching for a new diet food easier for Manan.

###  How it was used in the UI/UX design? 
1.	Abhishek Singh wants to lead a healthy and fit life and therefore avoids eating unhealthy food item. Our site could provide him with the nutritional value and ingredients used for each recipes. Thus, helping him decide how to plan his meals.
	
2. Abhishek is outgoing by nature and love exploring each and every thing. In this way, our            site could help him discover and explore food in a better yet easy way.

###  How it was used in the UI/UX design?
1.	Rakesh Verma is interested in trying different dishes and in this way, our site could help him explore various food item in much less time.
2.	Since Rakesh Verma is a senior developer in Amazon, therefore he doesn't want to waste time in exploring various varieties. Thus, our site would help him provide all the different varieties on a single platform.

We have used Structural Design Pattern for concern class.  Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces (basic layout) and define ways to compose objects to obtain functionalities like Add Review, Rating, etc. This Design pattern  speeded up our development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helped to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improveed code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.

Private Class Data:
Restricts accessor/mutator access

Proxy:
An object representing another object.

Bridge:
Separates an object’s interface from its implementation

Composite:
A tree structure of simple and composite objects

In addition, patterns allowed us to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. This design pattern was improved over the sprints, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.

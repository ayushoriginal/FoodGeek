# User Personas and How they influenced the UI/UX design

### How it was used in the UI/UX design? 
1.  	Ram Prakash doesn’t want to involve traditional advertising to spread word about his restaurant. Our website design enables food outlets to showcase their menu items (On the Menu Page) with ratings information and comments (both positive and negative) from independent customers, thus making the reviews more authentic.
2.  	He finds it frustrating that only taste is used as a factor in judging the quality of the dishes. We have designed the ‘Add Food Item’ page in such a way that people need to provide ingredients information from which nutritional data would be generated in our final Menu Page. Thus, the nutritional information is also showcased along with the information about the dishes so that health conscious customers can make an informed choice and the food outlets are encouraged to serve nutritious food items. This satisfies Ram Prakash’s frustration that the quality and nutritional value of the menu wasn’t getting attention.
3.  	Ram Prakash is a family man. He doesn’t like to work overtime in the hotel. The website can be operated from anywhere and allows him to put out menus, read comments, receive feedback etc. from the comfort of his home. Thus, he can multi-task by being with his family and simultaneously supervising and managing the online presence of the hotel.
